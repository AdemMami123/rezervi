# Rating System Implementation - Test Guide

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive rating system for Rezervi with the following features:

### ✅ Backend Implementation
1. **Database Integration**: Uses existing `reviews` table from schema
2. **API Endpoints**: Created `/api/reviews/*` routes with full CRUD operations
3. **Authentication**: Protected routes require authentication via middleware
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Users cannot review the same business twice
5. **Business Discovery Integration**: Added rating data to business discovery endpoint

### ✅ Frontend Components Created
1. **StarRating.jsx**: Reusable star rating component
2. **RatingModal.jsx**: Modal for submitting/updating reviews
3. **ReviewsList.jsx**: Component to display individual reviews and statistics

### ✅ UI Updates
1. **BusinessDiscovery.jsx**: Updated to show real ratings instead of hardcoded values
2. **BusinessDetailModal.jsx**: Enhanced with full rating system integration

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/reviews/business/:business_id` - Get reviews for a business
- `GET /api/reviews/ratings` - Get all business ratings for discovery page

### Protected Endpoints (require authentication)
- `POST /api/reviews/submit` - Submit a new review
- `PUT /api/reviews/:review_id` - Update a review
- `DELETE /api/reviews/:review_id` - Delete a review
- `GET /api/reviews/can-review/:business_id` - Check if user can review
