# Profile Picture Upload Fix

**Issue**: Profile pictures upload to the bucket but don't appear in the profile

**Root Cause**: The `profile_picture_url` column was missing from the users table schema, and the `getMe` endpoint wasn't returning it.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Database Migration Created
**File**: `supabase/migrations/20251007_add_profile_picture_url.sql`

Added the `profile_picture_url` column to the users table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_url TEXT DEFAULT NULL;

COMMENT ON COLUMN users.profile_picture_url IS 'URL to user profile picture stored in Supabase Storage';
```

### 2. ✅ Schema Updated
**File**: `supabase/enhanced_schema.sql`

Added `profile_picture_url text,` to the users table definition.

### 3. ✅ Backend API Fixed
**File**: `server/controller/authController.js`

#### getMe() Function
- **Before**: Didn't include `profile_picture_url` in SELECT query
- **After**: Added `profile_picture_url` to SELECT and response

```javascript
// SELECT query now includes
.select('id, email, username, phone_number, birthday, role, profile_picture_url, created_at')

// Response now includes
res.status(200).json({
  // ... other fields
  profile_picture_url: userData.profile_picture_url,
  // ...
});
```

#### uploadProfilePicture() Function
Already working correctly - uploads to bucket and updates the database.

## How to Deploy

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_url TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd server
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Profile Picture Upload
1. Login to your account
2. Go to profile page
3. Click on profile picture or camera icon
4. Select an image
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. **Expected Result**: Image should appear immediately after save

---

## How It Works

### Upload Flow:
1. **Frontend** → User selects image → FormData with file
2. **Backend** → `uploadProfilePicture()` endpoint receives file
3. **Storage** → Upload to Supabase 'profile images' bucket
4. **Database** → Update users table with public URL
5. **Frontend** → Calls `getMe()` to refresh user data
6. **Display** → Shows `user.profile_picture_url` in image tag

### Previous Problem:
- ❌ Column didn't exist → Database update failed silently
- ❌ `getMe()` didn't return field → Frontend never got the URL
- ✅ Image was in bucket but user object had no URL

### After Fix:
- ✅ Column exists → Database update succeeds
- ✅ `getMe()` returns URL → Frontend receives the URL
- ✅ Image displays correctly in profile

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run migration in Supabase
- [ ] Restart backend server
- [ ] Login to application
- [ ] Go to profile page
- [ ] Upload new profile picture
- [ ] Verify image appears immediately
- [ ] Refresh page - image should persist
- [ ] Check Supabase Storage bucket for file
- [ ] Check users table for profile_picture_url value

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `supabase/migrations/20251007_add_profile_picture_url.sql` - NEW
2. ✅ `supabase/enhanced_schema.sql` - Added column
3. ✅ `server/controller/authController.js` - Added field to getMe response

## Notes

- Profile pictures are stored in the **'profile images'** bucket
- File naming: `{userId}-{timestamp}.{extension}`
- Cache control: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Column is nullable (optional field)
- No RLS issues - uses admin client for storage operations

**Status**: ✅ READY TO DEPLOY  
**Priority**: High (User-facing feature)  
**Downtime**: None (additive change only)
