# Business Owner Notification System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive notification system that displays weekly reservation statistics to business owners upon successful login.

## Implementation Date
October 9, 2025

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Backend API Endpoint**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /api/business/reservations/weekly-stats`
   - **Location**: `server/controller/businessController.js`
   - **Route**: `server/routes/businessRoutes.js`
   
#### Functionality:
- Calculates current week (Monday to Sunday)
- Counts new reservations created during the current week
- Counts cancellations for the current week
- Returns JSON with statistics:
  ```json
  {
    "stats": {
      "newReservations": 5,
      "cancellations": 2,
      "startDate": "2025-10-06",
      "endDate": "2025-10-12"
    }
  }
  ```

#### Week Calculation Logic:
- Week starts on Monday at 00:00:00
- Week ends on Sunday at 23:59:59
- Handles Sunday edge case (Sunday is day 0, goes back 6 days to Monday)

### 2. **Frontend Integration**

#### Toast Notification System (App.js):
- Uses `react-hot-toast` library (already installed)
- Configured global Toaster component:
  - Position: Top-right corner
  - Duration: 5 seconds (auto-dismiss)
  - Custom styling with dark theme
  - High z-index for visibility above other UI elements

#### Login Flow Enhancement (Login.jsx):
1. User submits login credentials
2. Authentication succeeds
3. Check if user owns a business (`/api/business/user-business`)
4. If business owner:
   - Fetch weekly stats (`/api/business/reservations/weekly-stats`)
   - Display toast notification with stats
5. If not a business owner: No notification shown
6. Navigate to home page

#### Notification Variants:

**When there are new reservations or cancellations:**
```
ðŸ“Š Weekly Update: You have 5 new reservations and 2 cancellations this week
```

**When there are no updates:**
```
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome back! No new reservations or cancellations this week.
```

## Files Modified

   - Added `getWeeklyReservationStats()` function
   - Exported new function in module.exports

2. **`server/routes/businessRoutes.js`**
   - Imported `getWeeklyReservationStats`
   - Added route: `router.get('/reservations/weekly-stats', getWeeklyReservationStats);`

### Frontend Files:
1. **`client/src/App.js`**
   - Imported `Toaster` from 'react-hot-toast'
   - Added `<Toaster />` component with configuration

2. **`client/src/pages/Login.jsx`**
   - Imported `toast` from 'react-hot-toast'
   - Added business owner check after login
   - Added weekly stats fetch and notification logic

---

## Technical Details

### Week Calculation Algorithm:
```javascript
const now = new Date();
const currentDay = now.getDay(); // 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.
const daysToMonday = currentDay === 0 ? 6 : currentDay - 1;

// Start of week (Monday)
const startOfWeek = new Date(now);
startOfWeek.setDate(now.getDate() - daysToMonday);
startOfWeek.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

// End of week (Sunday)
const endOfWeek = new Date(startOfWeek);
endOfWeek.setDate(startOfWeek.getDate() + 6);
endOfWeek.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
```

### Database Query:
```javascript
const { data: weeklyReservations, error } = await req.supabase
  .from('reservations')
  .select('id, status, created_at')
  .eq('business_id', business_id)
  .gte('date', startDate)
  .lte('date', endDate);
```

### New Reservations Logic:
- Filters reservations where `created_at` falls within current week
- Counts all reservations created this week, regardless of status

### Cancellations Logic:
- Filters reservations with `status === 'cancelled'`
- Counts cancellations scheduled for this week

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Endpoint protected by `protect` middleware
2. **Authorization**: Only business owners can access their own stats
3. **Error Handling**: Silent failures on stats fetch to not disrupt login flow
4. **Data Validation**: Business ownership verified before stats retrieval

---

## User Experience

### Notification Behavior:
- **Position**: Top-right corner (non-intrusive)
- **Duration**: 5 seconds (auto-dismiss)
- **Dismissible**: User can manually close
- **Visibility**: High z-index (9999) ensures visibility
- **Styling**: Dark theme with custom colors
- **Icons**: Emojis for visual appeal (ðŸ“Š, ðŸ””, ðŸ‘‹)

### UX Flow:
1. User logs in
2. Brief authentication moment
3. If business owner: Notification appears immediately
4. Notification auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
5. User can continue using the app seamlessly

5. **Email Digest**: Optional weekly email summary
6. **Customizable Frequency**: Allow users to choose notification frequency
7. **Multi-language Support**: Translate notification messages
8. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track notification engagement metrics

### Additional Features:

```javascript
<Toaster 
  position="top-right"
  toastOptions={{
    duration: 5000,
    style: {
      background: '#363636',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '16px',
      borderRadius: '8px',
      fontSize: '14px',
    },
    success: {

      },
    },
  }}
/>
```

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors:
- Business not found: Returns 500 error
- Database query failure: Returns 400 error
- Authentication failure: Handled by middleware

### Frontend Errors:
- Stats fetch failure: Silent (logged to console)
- Business check failure: Silent (user treated as non-business owner)
- Login failure: Displays error message to user

## Maintenance Notes

### Code Locations:
- Backend logic: `server/controller/businessController.js` (lines ~615-680)
- Backend route: `server/routes/businessRoutes.js` (line ~66)
- Frontend toast setup: `client/src/App.js` (lines ~103-130)

---

## Conclusion

The notification system is fully implemented and ready for testing. It provides business owners with immediate visibility into their weekly performance upon login, without disrupting the user experience for non-business users. The implementation is secure, efficient, and follows best practices for error handling and user experience design.
