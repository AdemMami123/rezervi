# Database Schema Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The application code was trying to use a `bookings` table with `user_id` fields, but the actual database schema used a `reservations` table with `client_id` fields.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated businessController.js
- **getBusinessReservations**: Changed from `bookings` to `reservations` table
- **updateReservationStatus**: Changed from `bookings` to `reservations` table
- Fixed foreign key relationships and field mappings
- Added proper user name fetching via foreign key relationship

### 2. Updated userController.js
- **getUserBookings**: Changed from `bookings` table with `user_id` to `reservations` table with `client_id`
- **updateUserBooking**: Updated to work with `reservations` table and `payment_status` field
- Maintained frontend compatibility by returning data in expected format

### 3. Updated clientController.js
- **getBusinessAvailability**: Changed from `bookings` to `reservations` table
- **createBooking**: Changed to create records in `reservations` table with `client_id`
- Updated availability checking logic
- Fixed foreign key relationship names in select queries

## Schema Compatibility
The changes ensure compatibility with the existing database schema:

### Original Schema Structure:
```sql
-- reservations table
create table reservations (
  id uuid primary key,
  client_id uuid references users(id), -- NOT user_id
  business_id uuid references businesses(id),
  date date,
  time time,
  payment_status text check (payment_status in ('unpaid', 'paid'))
);
```

### Application Expectations:
- Frontend expects `booking_date`, `booking_time` fields
- Frontend expects customer information
- Frontend expects business information via relationships

## Data Transformation
Added proper data transformation in all controllers to ensure frontend compatibility:

```javascript
// Example transformation
const transformedBookings = reservations.map(reservation => ({
  ...reservation,
  booking_date: reservation.date,
  booking_time: reservation.time,
  customer_name: reservation.users?.full_name || 'Unknown',
  business_name: reservation.businesses?.name,
  status: 'confirmed' // Default for compatibility
}));
```

## Enhanced Schema Provided
Created `enhanced_schema.sql` with additional fields and tables the application expects:
- Enhanced `reservations` table with customer fields for non-registered users
- Added `business_settings` table for business configuration
- Added proper indexes and RLS policies
- Extended business types to match frontend options

## Testing Verification
- Server responds correctly to API calls
- Business discovery endpoint working
- Frontend application loads without errors
- Database relationships properly established

## API Endpoints Verified
- `GET /api/businesses/discover` ✅
- `GET /api/business/reservations` ✅ (updated to use reservations table)
- `PUT /api/business/reservations/:id` ✅ (updated to use reservations table)
- `GET /api/user/bookings` ✅ (updated to use reservations table)
- `PUT /api/user/bookings/:id` ✅ (updated to use reservations table)

## Frontend Compatibility
All changes maintain full frontend compatibility by:
- Preserving expected field names in API responses
- Maintaining the same API endpoint structure
- Providing proper data transformations
- Ensuring booking/reservation data flows correctly

The application now correctly uses the `reservations` table with `client_id` fields as defined in your database schema, while maintaining all the enhanced business owner functionality.
