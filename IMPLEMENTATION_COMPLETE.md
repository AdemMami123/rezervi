## üöÄ Next Steps (What You Need to Do)

### STEP 1: Apply Database Migration ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
You must run the database migration before testing:

```powershell
# Option A: Using Supabase CLI (if installed)
cd "c:\Users\ademm\OneDrive\Desktop\Personal Projects\rezervi"
supabase db push

# Option B: Manual SQL execution
# 1. Open Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
# 2. Copy content from: supabase/migrations/20251007_add_user_registration_fields.sql
# 3. Execute the query
```

### STEP 2: Restart Backend Server
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\ademm\OneDrive\Desktop\Personal Projects\rezervi\server"
node index.js
```

### STEP 3: Test Registration
Your frontend is already running. Navigate to:
- http://localhost:3000/register

Test with these sample values:
- **Full Name**: John Doe
- **Username**: johndoe123
- **Phone Number**: +1 234 567 8900
- **Birthday**: Select a date (13+ years ago)
- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: password123
- **Confirm Password**: password123

Try a different username.

Use format: +1 234 567 8900

### "You must be at least 13 years old"
Select a birthday that makes you 13+ years old.

### Database migration fails
Check if columns already exist. If yes, migration already ran.

### Backend errors
- Check if backend server is running
- Check console for error messages
- Verify all environment variables are set

## üéØ API Endpoint Changes

### Before:
```javascript
POST /auth/register
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "full_name": "John Doe"  // optional
}
```

### After:
```javascript
POST /auth/register
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "full_name": "John Doe",        // REQUIRED
  "username": "johndoe123",       // NEW - REQUIRED

**Recommendation**: Prompt existing users to update their profiles with real data.
